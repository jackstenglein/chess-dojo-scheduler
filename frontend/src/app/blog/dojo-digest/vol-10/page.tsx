                    <strong>Master's Database</strong> - We now have a database of
                    master-level games, filterable by time control! We currently have
                    250,000 games available and are in the process of uploading another 5
                    million! The database will then be updated weekly with the latest
                    games. To search the database, just open the Position Explorer tab and
                    you'll be able to choose between Dojo members' annotated games, the
                    Lichess database and the new masters database.

                    <strong>Endgame Tests</strong> - In addition to our tactics tests, we
                    now have endgame tests for all rating groups. The endgame tests will
                    soon be part of a player's endgame rating on their profile, similar to
                    the existing tactics rating. You can take the new tests here.

                    <strong>Positional Tests</strong> - are coming soon. We are
                    beta-testing them now. The particular challenge is asking for an
                    evaluation and then grading it. No other website has ever done this!

                    <strong>A Lesson from the Tests</strong> - The most common mistake we
                    see across the Dojo is players moving too fast. People generally move
                    too fast out of anxiety and exhaustion. While you might not feel
                    exhausted in the same way as with physical work, your system two
                    thinking can only go so far and it’s at that point when you make an
                    impulsive move. We are seeing this phenomenon in the tests too:
                    players are so sure of their answers that they often are not using all
                    of their allotted time. The Dojo hopes these tests will train
                    patience, reflection and a judgement of our first instincts!
