                <Question>What has been your journey with chess so far?</Question>

                <Typography>
                    I'm 33 and I got serious about chess at 26, when an adolescent kid
                    beat me up. I got mad and started watching Ben Finegold on YouTube.
                    The fact that I didn't learn anything about it in my childhood hurts
                    me, but I do everything I can to compensate for that. First I played
                    on Lichess, then joined the next-door club, and started going to
                    tournaments regularly. I'm your definition of an adult improver, as
                    everything I learned in chess I learned as an adult. I have 2 kids
                    now, so I wake up every day at 4am to analyse and do ChessDojo stuff.
                </Typography>

                <Question>Why did you join the Dojo?</Question>

                <Typography>
                    I was stuck below 1300, and wanted to get better. My long-term goal is
                    to work as a chess coach, either part-time or full-time.
                </Typography>

                <Question>What are your main chess goals?</Question>
                <Typography>
                    Keeping my mind fresh is the most important thing. Mentally I
                    experience a lot of growth because of this hobby. I see a lot of
                    players over 70 at tournaments whose minds are still clean. I want to
                    keep playing while I live on this Earth. As of September 2024 my club
                    plays in national second division, and I'm proud to be part of the
                    small squad. I want to play in div. 2 as much as possible, and I want
                    to get to 1800 by trusting the program. I am so thankful for this
                    community.
                </Typography>

                <Question>What is a non-chess fun fact about you?</Question>
                <Typography>
                    I refuse to work full-time! Life is too short to work 50-60 hours per
                    week. I work from Monday till Thursday.
