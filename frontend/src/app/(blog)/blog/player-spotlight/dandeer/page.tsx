                <Question>What has been your journey with chess so far?</Question>

                <Typography>
                    I'm 33 and I got serious about chess at 26, when an adolescent kid beat me up. I
                    got mad and started watching Ben Finegold on YouTube. The fact that I didn't
                    learn anything about it in my childhood hurts me, but I do everything I can to
                    compensate for that. First I played on Lichess, then joined the next-door club,
                    and started going to tournaments regularly. I'm your definition of an adult
                    improver, as everything I learned in chess I learned as an adult. I have 2 kids
                    now, so I wake up every day at 4am to analyse and do ChessDojo stuff.
                </Typography>

                <Question>Why did you join the Dojo?</Question>

                <Typography>
                    I was stuck below 1300, and wanted to get better. My long-term goal is to work
                    as a chess coach, either part-time or full-time.
                </Typography>

                <Question>What are your main chess goals?</Question>
                <Typography>
                    Keeping my mind fresh is the most important thing. Mentally I experience a lot
                    of growth because of this hobby. I see a lot of players over 70 at tournaments
                    whose minds are still clean. I want to keep playing while I live on this Earth.
                    As of September 2024 my club plays in national second division, and I'm proud to
                    be part of the small squad. I want to play in div. 2 as much as possible, and I
                    want to get to 1800 by trusting the program. I am so thankful for this
                    community.
                </Typography>

                <Question>What is a non-chess fun fact about you?</Question>
                <Typography>
                    I refuse to work full-time! Life is too short to work 50-60 hours per week. I
                    work from Monday till Thursday.
