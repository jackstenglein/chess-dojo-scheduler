                2) He's taking his time! That's one of the biggest problems the Dojo sees
                in players at his level (1300-1400 cohort).

                Sensei Kraai thinks the following two areas will be the biggest challenge:
            </Typography>
            <br />
            <Typography>
                1) He needs to tighten up his grip on the board, ie he sometimes still
                hangs pieces. This can be helped by: doing the mates (I know I know, it's
                not that fun!) and doing any kind of calculation work where you have to
                see a couple moves ahead, where you are forced to see what controls what.
                This is sweatwork.
            </Typography>
            <br />
            <Typography>
                2) He needs to trust in development! In too many games, Jan is giving away
                time for free. He needs to get some tempo religion. Das Tempo ist die
                Seele des Schaches (Time is the Soul of Chess) – Siegbert Tarrasch.
