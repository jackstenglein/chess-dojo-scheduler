                    <strong>File Sharing</strong> - Two months ago, we announced our file
                    system for organizing your games and repertoires. Today, we're
                    releasing a major update, which allows you to share public or private
                    folders with other users. You can add users as viewers, editors or
                    admins.

                    <strong>Engines</strong> - If you missed it last month, Stockfish 16
                    and 17 are now available in the Dojo's game annotator. Since then,
                    we've added some new features:
                </Typography>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can view the engine's expected Win/Draw/Loss percentages under
                        the main eval. In the engine settings, there is an option called
                        Primary Eval Type. You can use this to display WDL percentages
                        next to each line instead of the normal numeric eval.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clicking on the eval box next to a line will add that full line to
                        your PGN and insert a comment with the engine name, eval, depth
                        and WDL percentages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is now an option in the engine settings and the game viewer
                        settings to highlight the full engine line in the PGN text, in
                        addition to the fish icon that displays at the start of the line.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <Typography>
                    Remember, don't check your games with the engine until you've finished
                    your own analysis.
