                    <strong>Engines</strong> - Stockfish 17 (desktop version) and
                    Stockfish 16 (mobile version) are now both available in our game
                    annotator. Both engines run locally in your browser, although we plan
                    to add stronger, cloud-based engines soon. Of course, with great power
                    comes great responsibility, and the Dojo has always advocated
                    thoughtful analysis rather than regurgitating engine lines. We still
                    encourage all our users to fully analyze their games on their own and
                    come to their own conclusions before checking the engine. To push you
                    in the right direction, clicking a new engine line will add a fish
                    icon to your PGN, so that everyone can see which moves were found with
                    Stockfish:
