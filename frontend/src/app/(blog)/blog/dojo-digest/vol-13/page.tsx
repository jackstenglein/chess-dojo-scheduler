                    <strong>Engines</strong> - Stockfish 17 (desktop version) and Stockfish 16
                    (mobile version) are now both available in our game annotator. Both engines run
                    locally in your browser, although we plan to add stronger, cloud-based engines
                    soon. Of course, with great power comes great responsibility, and the Dojo has
                    always advocated thoughtful analysis rather than regurgitating engine lines. We
                    still encourage all our users to fully analyze their games on their own and come
                    to their own conclusions before checking the engine. To push you in the right
                    direction, clicking a new engine line will add a fish icon to your PGN, so that
                    everyone can see which moves were found with Stockfish:
