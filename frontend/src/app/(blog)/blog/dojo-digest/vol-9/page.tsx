                    : tactics, endgame, and positional. On May 1st we posted our tests for
                    1500-2000 and 2000+. June 1st will see the rollout of tests for all
                    cohorts. As expected we had a lot to learn about the user interface,
                    how to grade the tests, and how to make the tests. I’d like to think
                    we’ve gotten much better at it in just a few short weeks. Feedback
                    from the Dojo community was a big part of all the small improvements
                    we made. The endgame tests will go out sometime soon and then the
                    positional tests after that.

                    <strong>User Interface</strong> - You’ve probably noticed that the
                    site looks nicer and is easier to use. This is due to the hard work of
                    Jack’s two new helpers, NMP and Bestieboots. Every day brings a host
                    of small improvements to the site.
