                    The entire Dojo helped made this book happen. As Sensei Kraai likes to
                    say: the miracle of the Dojo is that players of all levels took up and
                    enjoyed the task of annotating their games. It was not at all clear
                    that we could get players to do it, but we knew they would have to if
                    they wanted to progress. Watch Jesse's video about the book{' '}

                    It’s the best way to get a regular classical game when you can’t make
                    it to a tournament – no cheaters or players moving ultra fast, and
                    you’ll often get a post-mortem. We now have at least one tournament in
                    most cohorts. The tournaments are currently limited to Dojo
                    subscribers, but we’re hoping to open the tournaments up to non-Dojo
                    players in the near future. Below is the crosstable for the 16-1700
                    cohort.

                    Gardner didn’t lose a single game and tied for first in the advanced
                    division while Brandon Lopez tied for second in the u/800. Are you
                    part of a team that wants to have their own scoreboard where you can
