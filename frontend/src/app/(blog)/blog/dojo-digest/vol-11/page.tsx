                    <strong>Tablebase</strong> - The Dojo database now supports tablebase,
                    which solves all seven-piece (or less) endgames. It’s an incredibly
                    powerful tool that allows for easy navigation of complex endgames.

                    Julio Becerra in the final round. Kraai had practiced the line several
                    times in sparring against Kostya as part of his work in the Dojo
