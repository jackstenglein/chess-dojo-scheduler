                <Typography mt={2}>
                    Introduced several weeks ago, you can now set a weekly training goal (in terms
                    of hours) and the new Dojo algorithm will populate your schedule with tasks from
                    your training plan. The tasks it suggests will be based on the buckets you have
                    the most to do in. You can also pin tasks to have them show up every day. Don't
                    set your goal too high! The heatmap will reflect if you hit your weekly goal or
                    not with a ‚úÖ or ‚ùå.

                <Typography mt={4}>
                    Based on member feedback, some books were moved, a few were taken out, and a few
                    were added to the program in various sections (Tactics, Middlegames, Endgames).
                    In general we have tried not to change things too dramatically as we continue to
                    hone in the plan.
                </Typography>
                <Typography mt={4}>
                    Very soon (like today or tomorrow), you'll be able to pin any task, including
                    tasks in other cohorts. So if the book you're reading is in a different cohort,
                    you can select that cohort from the dropdown menu under training plan, locate
                    the task, and pin it üìå so that it shows up for you at the top. Your time &
                    progress logged will still count for your heatmap/activity tracker.

                <Typography mt={4}>
                    Every cohort now has a minimum req to play 40 classical games per year. This is
                    regardless of level. So if you play 20 games this year and then graduate, you
                    will only have 20 games left to complete the requirement, rather than resetting
                    your progress to 0 and having to log another 40 games.
                </Typography>

                <Typography mt={4}>
                    Keep in mind that this is a suggested minimum, more is better! You will continue
                    to earn credit for any games played past 40. The same goes for the Review w/
                    plus, minus, & equal tasks -- you can do more than the suggested minimum and
                    still earn credit.

                    The goal is to encourage folks to play and review their games as much as

                    year!
