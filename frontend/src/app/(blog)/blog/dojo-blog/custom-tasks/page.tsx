                    This means students can now add any books, exercises, or tasks of their choice
                    to the relevant category (Games & Analysis, Tactics, Openings, Middlegames,
                    Endgames) and track their progress accordingly!

                    Additionally, you can now give your custom tasks goals, so that they track your
                    progress just like regular tasks in the program, rather than just tracking time.

                    At the bottom of each category, there will be a button to add custom tasks. You
                    can also move your existing custom tasks from Non-Dojo to other categories, and
                    your heatmap and timeline will be updated to match. There is no need to manually
                    copy data between two custom tasks.
