                What makes a tournament truly legendary?
            </Typography>

            <Typography mt={4}>
                What makes a chess tournament great? Is it the strength of the field? The historical
                stakes? The quality of the games? Or the storylines that echo through chess history
                for decades?<br></br>
                <br></br>
                In a recent episode of Dojo Talks, the team tackled one of the most ambitious
                questions in chess history: What are the 10 greatest chess tournaments of all time?
                Joined by TheChessNerd, the discussion ranged from 19th-century classics to brutal
                Soviet-era candidates and modern super tournaments, debating not just which events
                mattered, but why they mattered.<br></br>
                <br></br>
                This wasn’t just a list—it was a deep dive into the soul of competitive chess.

                Why Tournaments Matter in Chess History
            </Typography>
            <Typography mt={4}>
                Unlike world championship matches, tournaments give us something unique:
            </Typography>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple elite players clashing in a single arena</li>
                <li>Stylistic battles across generations</li>
                <li>Breakout performances and career-defining collapses</li>
                <li>And, sometimes, the birth of entirely new ideas</li>
            </ul>
            <Typography mt={4}>
                Many of the tournaments discussed didn’t just crown winners—they changed the
                direction of chess.

                London 1851 – The Birth of International Chess
            </Typography>

            <Typography mt={4}>
                Every story has an origin, and for tournament chess, it begins here. <br></br>
                <br></br>London 1851 was the first international chess tournament ever held.
                Organized by Howard Staunton during the Great Exhibition, it brought together the
                strongest players of the era and introduced the idea that chess could be contested
                on a global stage. <br></br>
                <br></br>Adolf Anderssen’s victory helped establish him as the world’s leading
                player and set the stage for future legends like Paul Morphy. Without London 1851,
                the entire concept of elite international competition might never have taken root.

                Hastings 1895 – The First Modern Super Tournament
            </Typography>
            <Typography mt={4}>
                If London 1851 was the beginning, Hastings 1895 was the explosion. <br></br>
                <br></br>This event featured nearly every top player of the time: Lasker, Steinitz,
                Tarrasch, Chigorin—and an unknown American named Harry Nelson Pillsbury, who shocked
                the world by winning the tournament outright. <br></br>
                <br></br>It was long, grueling, stacked, and full of fighting chess. Many consider
                Hastings 1895 the first truly modern super tournament—where depth, endurance, and
                preparation all mattered.

                St. Petersburg 1914 – When Legends Collided
            </Typography>
            <Typography mt={4}>
                Few tournaments in history can boast a lineup like St. Petersburg 1914:
            </Typography>
            <ul>
                <li>Emanuel Lasker</li>
                <li>José Raúl Capablanca</li>
                <li>Alexander Alekhine</li>
                <li>Siegbert Tarrasch</li>
                <li>Frank Marshall</li>
                <li>Akiba Rubinstein</li>
                <li>Aron Nimzowitsch</li>
            </ul>
            <Typography mt={4}>
                This was a generational showdown. Lasker’s late surge to win the final stage,
                including his famous Exchange Ruy Lopez victory over Capablanca, is one of the most
                iconic moments in tournament history. <br></br>
                <br></br>It wasn’t just strong. It was mythic.

            <Typography mt={4}>
                If you care about pure strength of field, AVRO 1938 is hard to beat. <br></br>
                <br></br>Eight players. All elite. Multiple world champions. No filler. <br></br>
                <br></br>Alekhine, Capablanca, Botvinnik, Keres, Fine, Euwe, Reshevsky—this
                tournament was designed to answer one question: Who is the best player in the world?{' '}
                <br></br>
                <br></br>It also carried massive historical weight, as it took place on the eve of
                World War II, with several careers forever altered by what followed. Keres’
                brilliant performance remains one of the great “what if” stories in chess.

            </Typography>
            <Typography mt={4}>
                After Alekhine’s death, chess needed a new champion—and a new beginning. <br></br>
                <br></br>The 1948 World Championship tournament in The Hague and Moscow brought
                together Botvinnik, Smyslov, Keres, Reshevsky, and Euwe in a unique quintuple
                round-robin to decide the next king of chess. <br></br>
                <br></br>It wasn’t just about the title. It was about rebuilding international chess
                after the devastation of World War II. Botvinnik’s victory ushered in the Soviet era
                of dominance.

                the youngest grandmaster in history at the time. The tournament marked the moment

                So… What Makes a Tournament “Great”?
            </Typography>
            <Typography mt={4}>From the Dojo discussion, a few themes emerged:</Typography>
            <ul>
                <li>Strength of field – are the best players actually there?</li>
                <li>Historical stakes – does it decide a champion, a challenger, or a new era?</li>
                <li>Cultural impact – did it change how chess is played or understood?</li>
                <li>Endurance and struggle – short events feel different from two-month wars</li>
                <li>Storylines – rise of legends, falls of giants, and everything in between</li>
            </ul>
            <Typography mt={4}>
                Great tournaments aren’t just about who wins. They’re about what changes because of
                them.

            </Typography>
            <Typography mt={4}>
                What makes this topic so compelling is that there’s no single “correct” list. Every
                era has its heroes. Every fan has their bias. Some love purity of competition,
                others love historical drama, and others just want the longest, bloodiest fight
                possible. <br></br>
                <br></br>But one thing is clear: <br></br>
                <br></br>These tournaments didn’t just crown champions. <br></br>
                <br></br>They shaped chess history. <br></br>
                <br></br>And that’s what makes them timeless.
