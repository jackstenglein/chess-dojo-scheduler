                This month, I was tasked by{' '}
                <Link href='https://www.chessdojo.club/'>ChessDojo</Link> to improve their
                rating converter that maps the vast majority of classical chess ratings to
                each other. Most of us have heard about the FIDE rating boost that was
                applied in March 2024 to all players under 2000 FIDE. Because of the
                seismic shift this rating compression created in FIDE ratings, I decided
                to start from scratch and generate new ways to map all the ratings to each
                other. A key challenge in creating this universal rating converter was
                determining which ratings were stable and reliable, and which ratings
                should be largely ignored.

            <Typography>
                Without further ado, here is the universal rating converter, updated in
                September 2024. If you have a classical chess rating either online or OTB,
                you should be able to look up your cohort and approximate what rating you
                would have in any other rating system*** by simply reading across the row!

                <strong>Determining The Converted Ratings</strong>
            </Typography>
            <Divider sx={{ my: 1 }} />
            <Typography>
                The ultimate goal of this converter is to be able to accurately compare a
                player's strength across all the rating systems even if they only have
                played classical games in one or two of these rating systems.
                <br />
                <br />
                In determining these numbers, I compared OTB ratings to other OTB ratings
                when available. I also compared OTB ratings to online ratings (with low
                rating deviation) when available.
                <br />
                <br />I took data from many sources: thousands of ChessDojo training
                program members who had low rating deviations in their classical lichess
                ratings and/or rapid chesscom ratings but also had an OTB rating, the FIDE
                player list, the ACF player list, the DWZ player list, and the ECF player
                list, all from September 1st 2024. I tried to only consider data that was
                reliable by basing the ratings mostly on online:OTB ratings for the lower
                rated cohorts and OTB:OTB ratings for the higher rated cohorts. Since the
                pool of online players thins out dramatically near the very top, I can
                only truly compare their OTB ratings to each other.
                <br />
                <br />
                As an example, consider someone who has a 1550 lichess classical rating,
                1050 chesscom rapid rating, and 1430 FIDE rating. They are much more
                likely to have accurate online ratings rather than OTB. In contrast,
                someone who has a 2300 lichess classical rating and 1850 chesscom rapid
                rating, but is 2100 FIDE and 2300 USCF is much more likely to have
                accurate OTB ratings. There are a variety of reasons why someone of that
                strength has a low chesscom rating (they prefer lichess, they use chesscom
                just to try random openings, they don't care about that rating and so are
                happy to abort the occasional game, they don't like running into cheaters
                and so don't play often). Therefore, my model won't weigh them heavily
                when determining the FIDE:lichess mapping, for instance.
                <br />

                Based on my input data and the above plots (among others I generated - I
                did not want to burden readers with infinite plots!), we are able to draw
                some interesting conclusions.
            </Typography>
            <br />

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Even the absolute lowest OTB ratings don't correspond well to online
                    ratings. Anyone rated under 1250 lichess classical or 550 chesscom
                    rapid is characterized as a complete beginner according to most OTB
                    ratings shown above. That's practically 20% of all lichess classical
                    players and 42% of all chesscom rapid players. That gives you an idea
                    of how much tougher OTB is compared to online. You should be stronger
                    than a decent amount of online players before it makes any sense to
                    even try for an OTB rating.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    The absolute top of the online rating pools do not provide reasonable
                    estimates for OTB ratings. I would personally draw the line at 2275
                    chesscom rapid and 2310 lichess classical ratings --- those are
                    probably the highest online ratings to provide an accurate estimate
                    for OTB strength. Above that, you simply don't have a player base on
                    either website. These ratings corresponds to the 99.5% percentile on
                    lichess and the 99.9% percentile on chesscom. According to my
                    estimator, gaining a measly 160 lichess classical rating points takes
                    you from a good club player at 2000 FIDE to GM strength. That
                    shouldn't make sense to you because it doesn't make sense! There just
                    aren't many titled players playing classical time controls online for
                    that rating to be meaningful.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    USCF players indeed do not have accurate FIDE ratings until roughly
                    the 2000 FIDE mark. This is shown by the fact that the model comparing
                    the ratings underestimates the actual FIDE ratings of the players
                    until near the top. This effect has been noted by many people in the
                    past - there simply are not enough FIDE tournaments in the USA for
                    players to get an accurate FIDE rating. To a lesser extent, this is
                    true when comparing the ECF to FIDE ratings as well.

                    an easy way to compare ECF and FIDE ratings. Based on my results, I
                    believe their measurement underestimates a player's FIDE rating for
                    the low end and overestimates a player's FIDE rating for the high end.
                    If you want an extremely simple estimator, I think a more accurate
                    estimate is ECF = 1.4 * FIDE - 715 under 1940 FIDE, and ECF = FIDE +
                    60 for players over 1940 FIDE. If you want to flip the mapping around:
                    FIDE = 1/(1.4) * ECF + 510 for players under 2000 ECF, and FIDE = ECF
                    - 60 for players over 2000 FIDE. Hopefully, this more accurate mapping
                    is clean enough for ECF members to prefer instead.

                    The sad necessity to use chesscom rapid rapid ratings rather than a
                    classical rating is annoying. If chesscom had a classical time
                    control, then we would truly be able to compare apples to apples.
                    Unfortunately, they do not have a classical time control. Therefore,
                    this converter unfortunately is unevenly influenced by comparing 10+0
                    games on chesscom to 90+30 games OTB and on lichess. There's no way
                    around that, and it makes for a less satisfying comparison with what
                    is the biggest player base: chesscom users.

                I hope you have gotten something useful out of this universal rating
                converter! Let me know in the comments if you see something else
                surprising that you think I should address.

                the ChessDojo training program, for whom I was originally tasked with
                creating this converter. There is a free version if you're just looking
                for what training plan they suggest for each of the cohorts. Personally,
                I've been a paying member for more than 2 years now and couldn't be
                happier with the community and material they recommend.
