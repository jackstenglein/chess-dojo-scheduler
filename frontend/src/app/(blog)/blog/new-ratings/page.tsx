                    One of the first and essential building stones of the Dojo Training
                    Program was the creation of a universal rating system. It was a bit
                    like creating a universal currency from about eight national
                    currencies. Obviously some of these currencies will inflate and some
                    will deflate, so there will never be a fixed rate of exchange. And if
                    you'll let me play this analogy out a little further: in March the
                    central bank of Fide dramatically loosened its key interest rate. And
                    it was this action which forced us to reevaluate our exchange rates.
                </Typography>

                <Typography mt={2}>
                    Let me describe what happened. When I was a kid (in the last
                    millennium), you had to have a rating of 2200 to get a Fide rating.
                    But then, partly out of democratic impulse, Fide gradually lowered its
                    floor to 1000. The problem with 1000 is that several young and quickly
                    improving players can achieve it. Imagine thousands of young Indian
                    kids, all rapidly improving. If they mostly play each other, they will
                    all remain around 1000 despite being around 1600 strength. And if that
                    1000 rated player plays a game against a 1900, then deflation will
                    start. So, if Fide had kept the minimum rating at 2200 there would not
                    have been an inflationary impulse in the first place.
                </Typography>

                <Typography mt={2}>
                    Their controversial solution is the following formula: (0.4) x
                    (2000-rating). So if you are 2000+ you get nothing, whereas if you are
                    1000 you get catapulted to 1400. This is how we end up with the new
                    floor (1400). It's controversial as it adds a ton of points into the
                    system and we don't know how it will play out, especially at the top.
                    Will Magnus eventually be 3100 now?

                <Typography mt={2}>
                    For the Dojo rating system it's a real problem. We based our rating
                    system on the currency of Fide to begin with, but now our cohorts from
                    1000-2000 can't use Fide as its base currency anymore because that
                    1000 point range has been compressed to a 600 point range (1400-2000).
                </Typography>

                <Typography mt={2}>
                    So, what we've done (potentially as a temporary measure) is to base
                    the currency of the u/2000 cohorts on chess.com ratings. If the Fide
                    ratings eventually sort themselves by points trickling up the ladder,
                    we may switch back to using Fide.

                    We knew about this Fide problem when we decided to redo the
                    translator. We did not realize however how severe the inflation
                    problem with Lichess had become. Lichess gives every player who shows
                    up on their site an initial rating of 1500 and this has driven those
                    ratings up significantly since we did our first rating translator
                    several years ago. And the vast majority of the “demotions” that will
                    be taking place inside the Dojo are associated with this Lichess
                    inflation.
