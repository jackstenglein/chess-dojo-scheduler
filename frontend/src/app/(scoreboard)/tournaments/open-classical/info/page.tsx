                        This is a 7-round tournament run over 7 weeks, with one round per
                        week. Because this is a short tournament, we ask that you only
                        register if you anticipate that you will be able to play most of
                        the rounds. If you do require a bye in a particular round, you
                        will be able to submit your bye requests when registering. Please submit all of your bye requests when you register. Players
                        are limited to 2 bye requests per tournament.

                        The preferred time control for this tournament is as follows:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Open: 90+30</li>
                        <li>U1800: 60+30</li>

                    <Typography>
                        Players may opt to play a different time control than the preferred one only if both players agree. If a time control is not agreed upon, the preferred time control will be used. If one player cannot make the time to play the preferred time control they will forfeit the game.

                        will result in a forfeit loss for both players (0 - 0).

                        If a player's opponent 1. is unresponsive within 48 hours of you
                        reaching out to them to schedule your game, 2. does not make a
                        concerted effort to schedule a game in a round, or 3. does not

                        A concerted effort consists of either reaching out first or
                        responding to an initial contact within 48 hours; and offering at
                        least 3 different times, on at least 2 separate days, that you are
                        available to play that week. If both players make a concerted
                        effort to schedule a game and are still unable to find a time to
                        play, the game can be submitted as a draw (1/2-1/2). In case of a
                        dispute, please contact the TD on Discord.
