                            This is a 7-round tournament run over 7 weeks, with one round per week.
                            Because this is a short tournament, we ask that you only register if you
                            anticipate that you will be able to play most of the rounds. If you do
                            require a bye in a particular round, you will be able to submit your bye
                            requests when registering. Please submit all of your bye requests when
                            you register. Players are limited to 2 bye requests per tournament. A
                            new 7-round tournament will start again approximately one week after the
                            last one ends.

                            preferred time control will be used. If one player cannot agree to play
                            the preferred time control they will forfeit the game.
