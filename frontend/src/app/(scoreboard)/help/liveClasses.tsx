                    There are two types of classes: larger lectures and smaller, more personal Game
                    and Profile Review classes. The lectures cover a variety of different
                    specialized topics (for example endgame fundamentals, calculation or the
                    Najdorf) and rotate monthly. In the Game and Profile Review classes, the sensei
                    focuses on a single player each week, analyzing their training habits and (at
                    least) one of their annotated games.

                    This applies to both the lectures and the Game and Profile Review classes. The

                    $200/month subscription tier also provides access to the lecture classes. Both
                    subscription tiers provide full access to the rest of the ChessDojo training

                    The Game and Profile Review classes are split into the following rating ranges:
                    0-600, 600-1000, 1000-1400, 1400-1800, 1800+ (these ratings all use the{' '}
                    <Link href='/material/ratings'>ChessDojo rating scale</Link>). For the Game and
                    Profile Review classes, you can only join the class for your specific cohort.
                    The lectures are roughly split among the same rating ranges but may cover
                    broader or more targeted ranges for a given class. Each class will specify its
                    recommended rating range. Any subscriber can join the lecture classes, even if
                    they are outside the recommended rating range. However, the class material will
                    be designed for the recommended rating range.

                    The lecture classes have no limit on the amount of students that can join each
                    class. The Game and Profile Review classes will be limited to approximately 10
                    students. As more students join a given cohort range, they will be split into
                    additional sections. For example, there might be two sections of the 600-1000
                    Game and Profile Review, each with 7 students.
