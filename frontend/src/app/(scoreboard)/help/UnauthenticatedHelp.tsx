                    The Dojo Training Program is built around three simple ideas:

                            We need a a coach above us (plus), someone below us to teach (minus),
                            and a cohort to spar with (equal)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The most substantive form of chess improvement is the analysis of our

                    We give you a training plan (list of tasks) and a cohort (in Discord) to support
                    your journey. The most important task is to play long games and then analyze
                    them. The work is entirely self-paced, and you should definitely not try to rush
                    it. Yes, you can quickly skim the required reading and check off a box. But you
                    will find much more success if you spend time, by yourself and with your cohort,
                    truly studying the material.

                    You should put in "sweat work" at least three times a week. Sweat work should be
                    hard enough that you feel tired afterward. Examples include playing long games,
                    game analysis, solving difficult exercises, etc. Watching videos, playing blitz,
                    and doing lots of puzzle rush does not count as sweat work!

            content: (
                <>
                    A core task of the training plan is to play and annotate classical games. The
                    minimum accepted time controls for each rating are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Under 800: 30+0</li>
                        <li>800-1200: 30+30</li>
                        <li>1200+: 45+30</li>
                        <li>1600+: 60+30</li>
                        <li>2000+: 90+30</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each cohort has a different amount of games to play, but there is no requirement
                    on how often to play them. Many students try to play one classical game per
                    week; some try to play an OTB tournament every 1-2 months.

                    Yes â€“ you need to have the competitive pressure of long thinking in a classical
                    game to truly hone your skills, and you need that long game to be able to review
                    it after. It is not possible to review your own deep thinking in a blitz/rapid
                    game.

                        The Dojo currently requires that you have a rating when you sign up. This
                        allows us to determine which cohort you should be placed in. Your rating can
                        be provisional, but must be from one of the currently supported systems:
                        <ul>
                            {Object.values(ratingSystems).map((rs) => (
                                <li key={rs}>{formatRatingSystem(rs)}</li>
                            ))}
                        </ul>
                        If you currently don't have a rating in any of these systems, we recommend
                        creating an account on Chess.com or Lichess and playing a few games. It's
                        free and you will want an account for sparring anyway.
