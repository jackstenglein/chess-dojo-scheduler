He won the Denker tournament of High School Champions in 1989 and 1990 and the Irwin tournament of Senior Champions in 2023. He is currently using the Dojo Training Program with the dream of winning the US Senior Closed in 2024.',

Since attaining the IM title in 2016, he has struggled to find the time for his own study while also coaching. He is a FIDE trainer and has coached at the World Youth and Pan-American Youth Championships, earning several gold medals for the US national team. Like many of us he needs a structure and a plan! Kostya is committed to following the Dojo Training Program to the GM title, and we are rooting for him!',

With this madman approach, he attained the rank of International Master in 2003 and then in 2006 he won the prestigious Samford Chess Fellowship. He has all three Grandmaster norms and just needs to cross 2500 to reach the title. David helped design the ChessDojo Training Program with the dream that he could cross that difficult 2500 barrier using its guidance and structure.',
