1. Nf5! { [3] Any move saving the knight on e7 that is under attack would be appropriate here. This is the best of them by a small margin because it's the best square for the knight, and it does not let the black queen into the game via trade or Nd4.
NOTE: this is your final warning that not every position in the tactics test has a tactical solution! You can not just input whatever move looks violent like in some tactics trainers, as you will often come up against positions like this one, where you simply need to retreat a piece or develop a piece, and the “tactical moves” are mistakes. } (1. Nd5 { [ALT] } 1... Nd4 { This is a nice move for black, bringing the queen further into the action. }) (1. Nxc6 { [ALT] } 1... Qxc6 { Again this improves black’s queen. Also, the endgames are very tough to hold because of Be6 and the strength of that queenside majority. }) (1. Rbe1!? { [ALT] My second favorite option, bringing the b1 rook into the game. }) (1.
