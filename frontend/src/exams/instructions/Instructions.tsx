                        Unlike most online trainers, you play both your moves and your opponent's.
                        You will not receive feedback on any moves until the test is fully complete.

                        Points are awarded based on how many critical moves you find. A single
                        problem may have multiple variations for your opponent, so make sure to look
                        for different defenses and respond against each of them. It's up to you to
                        decide which variations are critical and how deep to continue each
                        variation.

                        solution. You can promote variations to select which moves will be included
                        in your solution.

                        up among the positions however you choose. You can also return to positions
