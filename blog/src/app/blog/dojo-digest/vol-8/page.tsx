                    We launched the training program 2 years ago with a Google doc and a
                    couple of paper clips. Since then, we&apos;ve made great technical
                    improvements and learned a lot about what chess improvement involves
                    across the rating spectrum. While we are constantly improving the
                    site, the release of 3.0 gave us the opportunity to revamp our program
                    using the experience of the last 2 years. Here are just some of the
                    biggest changes we&apos;ve launched:

                    <strong>Tactics Tests</strong> - We&apos;ve developed a new style of
                    tactics test! In normal tactics trainers, you make your move and the
                    computer plays a single line for your opponent. This can lead to bad
                    habits, as you don&apos;t always have to calculate all of your
                    opponent&apos;s resources. In the Dojo tests, you input moves for both
                    you and your opponent, and you&apos;re graded both on the mainline and
                    on variations:
                </Typography>

                >
                    In this example, we found the mainline but missed the opponent&apos;s
                    defense 18...Rac8 and its refutation, leading to a score of 7/11.

                    All test problems are hand-picked by one of the Dojo senseis, and the
                    solutions are lightly annotated. After you&apos;ve completed a test,
                    you can see how you stack up against the rest of the Dojo or against
                    just a few cohorts:

                    In this chart, the x-axis is the score on the test and the y-axis is
                    the calculated rating for the test. Different colors represent

                            appear on the site. This lets you work on your annotations and
                            get feedback, then publish to the rest of the Dojo when ready.
